This project delves into the rich history of the Olympic Games using Python for data analysis. We explore fascinating trends and insights hidden within historical Olympic datasets.  

# Strategy Stars - Capstone Project  
The Strategy Stars team is embarking on a data-driven capstone project aimed at leveraging insights from a comprehensive dataset of Olympics data to drive strategic decision-making. The project involves several stages, including data acquisition and exploration, data cleaning and analysis, data visualization, and deriving key inferences from the analyzed data. Each team member has been assigned specific roles and responsibilities to ensure the successful execution of each stage.    

## Team Members    
Hitha Choudhary G     
K Shreeshanth Gouda

# About the Dataset  
The project utilizes a dataset containing information on athletes who participated in the Olympic Games as well as noc_regions dataset. The data includes various features such as:  
•Athlete demographics (Name, Sex, Age, Height, Weight)    
•Team information (Team, NOC - National Olympic Committee)    
•Event details (Games, Year, Season, City)    
•Sports and disciplines (Sport, Event)    
•Medal achievements (Medal)    
•Region (Region, Notes)

# Methodology  
1. Data Acquisition and Exploring: Acquiring the dataset and exploring it to understand the underlying statistics within the dataset.
2. Data Cleaning and Preparation: Cleaning the data as it contains missing values and duplicates to avoid possible bias during analysis and providing suitable methods for preparing the dataset for further analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzing and visualizing the data to identify patterns and trends by employing libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and plotly.

# Data-Driven Insights   
With the help of EDA this project aims to deliver these possible insights:  
  1. Athlete Demographics and Participation: Undestanding participation patterns and athlete statistics.    
  2. Medal Distributuion: Exploring medal tally among nations, sports, Athletes.    
  3. Trends in Sports: Analyzing the performance trends of sports over time.  
  4. Summer vs Winter Olympics: Comparative analysis of athlete participation and trends between each season.  
  5. Social Factors: Analyzing how factors like gender equality and being a host country affects the performance.  
  6. Predictive Analysis: Developing models for future outcomes such as medal winners, leveraging historical data from the dataset.  

# Favourable Outcomes  
• Data-Empowered Decisions: Our ability to make evidence-based decisions is enhanced by data analysis, which replaces conjecture with knowledge. This methodology holds significance in diverse domains; understanding audience engagemnet, participation trends, geopolitical impact and social factors can play an important role.  
• Proactive Problem Solving: By analyzing data, we can uncover the root causes of issues, assess potential risks, and even predict future trends. This allows us to make proactive decisions and allocate resources efficiently.  
• Clear and Collaborative Communication: Data visualizations created with Python help translate complex findings into easily understandable formats. This fosters communication and collaboration among colleagues and the public. Imagine presenting research findings through clear and compelling visualizations, fostering better understanding and collaboration.
